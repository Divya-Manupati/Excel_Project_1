# Overview:

The Sales Dashboard project in Excel focuses on analyzing sales data based on various product categories.
The goal is to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into sales performance, profit, and regional trends.

The project utilizes the E-Commerce Dashboard dataset, which contains information such as order IDs, dates, product categories, 
sales amounts, quantities, and more. The dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing and visualizing sales data.

# Key Tasks:

1) Month-wise Sales and Profit Analysis: The project involves preparing a table that showcases sales and profit month-wise. 
This analysis helps identify trends and patterns in sales performance over time.

) Region-wise Sales Analysis: Another important aspect is preparing a region-wise sales table. This allows for the examination 
of sales performance across different regions, providing valuable insights into geographic variations.

3) User Control Combo Box: To enhance user interactivity, a user control combo box is implemented for selecting specific product 
categories. This functionality allows users to dynamically view sales trends and performance for different product categories.

4) Column Chart Creation: Utilizing the month-wise and region-wise tables, a column chart is generated. The column chart visually 
represents the sales data, making it easier to identify trends, compare categories, and highlight patterns.

5) Linking the Table with the Combo Box: The generated tables are linked with the user control combo box. This linkage ensures that 
the displayed data in the tables is dynamically updated based on the selected product category.

6) Dashboard Creation: Finally, all the components, including the tables, combo box, and column chart, are combined to create a 
comprehensive sales dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of sales performance, allowing users to gain insights at a glance.

The project requires proficiency in Microsoft Excel and the utilization of relevant features and tools, such as data analysis 
add-ins. By completing this project, I will demonstrated the ability to analyze sales data, create interactive visualizations, and
design an informative sales dashboard.
